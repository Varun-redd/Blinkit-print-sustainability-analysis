# Blinkit Print Sustainability Analysis 📄🌱

## Overview
This project analyzes paper waste generated by print orders and evaluates the impact of introducing an **Eco Mode** for single-page prints.  
The goal is to reduce unnecessary paper usage while delivering measurable **cost and sustainability benefits**.

---

## Problem Statement
Single-page print orders were generating additional acknowledgment pages, leading to avoidable paper waste, higher printing costs, and increased CO₂ emissions.

---

## Approach
The analysis is structured into three layers:

### 1. Executive Summary
- Current vs optimized print cost
- Total waste pages and waste reduction
- Estimated CO₂ impact

### 2. Waste Deep Dive
- Paper waste by order size and city
- Pareto analysis to identify key waste drivers
- Identification of priority segments for optimization

## Key Insights
- ~45% of orders generate avoidable paper waste
- Single-page orders contribute disproportionately to total waste
- Partial Eco Mode adoption delivers significant cost and waste reduction
- Sustainability gains align directly with cost efficiency

---

## Tools Used

- DAX (What-if parameters, scenario modeling)
- Excel (data preparation)

---

## Deliverables
- Interactive Power BI dashboard
- Scenario-based sustainability insights
- Actionable recommendations for phased rollout
